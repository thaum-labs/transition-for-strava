## ✨ Overview

Transition for Strava is a **mobile-first web app** that helps you export your Strava activities as GPX or FIT files, making it easy to move your data between apps or back up your activities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Visit [transitionforstrava.com](https://transitionforstrava.com)
2. Tap **Continue with Strava** to authenticate
3. Browse your activities (with elevation profiles!) or go to **Segments** to see your starred segments and efforts
4. Tap **Export** and choose **GPX** or **FIT**
5. On mobile: share directly to other apps
6. On desktop: download the file

## 🎯 Features

- 🔐 **Secure sign-in** - Sign in with your Strava account
- 📱 **Mobile-first** - Optimized for phones and tablets
- 🗺️ **GPX Export** - Universal compatibility
- 🏃 **FIT Export** - Generated for broad compatibility with devices and apps
- 🏷️ **Auto-detect Sport Type** - Automatically detects cycling, running, etc.
- 📊 **Rich Metrics** - Includes elevation, speed, heart rate, cadence, and power
- 🎨 **Elevation Profiles** - Visual elevation charts on activity cards
- ⭐ **Starred segments** - View your starred segments and track your best efforts over time (requires Strava Summit)
- 🔒 **Privacy-focused** - No data storage, encrypted sessions only

## 📋 How It Works

### Export Formats

- **GPX**: Generated from Strava GPS data. Universal format, works with most apps.
- **FIT**: Generated from your Strava data for broad compatibility. Includes sport type, speed, elevation gain, heart rate and more.

### Mobile vs Desktop

- **Mobile**: Share directly to other apps
- **Desktop**: Download the file

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

- **Segments** – Viewing your starred segments and effort history requires a **Strava Summit** (premium) subscription.
- **Not all activities can be exported** - Indoor/manual activities or privacy-restricted activities may not include GPS tracks
- **Mobile downloads vary by browser**:
  - iOS: Often requires opening from Safari downloads/Files before sharing
  - Android: Behavior varies by browser and download settings
- **FIT files are generated** - They're created from your Strava data, not the original device upload

## 🔒 Privacy

- ✅ **No credential storage** - We don't store your Strava credentials
- ✅ **No file storage** - Activity files are generated on-demand and never stored
- ✅ **Encrypted sessions** - Your session is kept secure
- ✅ **Official Strava sign-in** - We use Strava's sign-in flow
